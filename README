This project is about predicting customer churn for the online fashion industry. The data is fictitious and no conclusions should be drawn from it.

The project is made up of 2 files:
1) churnPreproc.py: this deals with the data preparation step using pandas, scipy, mathplotlib and few other standard libraries
2) churnModel: this runs 2 machine-learning models from the scikit-learn library (Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting)

To run, do:
 >> python churnModel.py
